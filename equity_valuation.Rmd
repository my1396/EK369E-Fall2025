# Portfolio Diversification Benefits

### Exercise: Portfolio Analysis

**Scenario:** Two assets with 5 periods of historical returns

| Period | Asset A (%) | Asset B (%) |
|--------|-------------|-------------|
| 1      | 10          | 12          |
| 2      | 6           | 16           |
| 3      | 14          | 8          |
| 4      | 2           | 4           |
| 5      | 18          | 20          |


---

### Step 1: Calculate Means and Standard Deviations

**Your Task:** Calculate mean and standard deviation for each asset

**Asset A:**
- Mean return = ?
- Standard deviation = ?

**Asset B:**
- Mean return = ?
- Standard deviation = ?

**Formulas:**
- Mean: $\bar{r} = \frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=1}^{n} r_i$
- Std Dev: $\sigma = \sqrt{\frac{1}{n-1}\sum_{i=1}^{n} (r_i - \bar{r})^2}$

---

### Step 2: Calculate Correlation Coefficient

**Your Task:** Calculate the correlation coefficient between Asset A and Asset B.

**Formulas:**
- Covariance: $\cov(r_A, r_B) = \frac{1}{n-1}\sum_{i=1}^{n} (r_{A,i} - \bar{r}_A)(r_{B,i} - \bar{r}_B)$
- Correlation: $\rho_{AB} = \frac{\cov(r_A, r_B)}{\sigma_A \sigma_B}$

---

### Step 3: Construct Equal-Weight Portfolio

**Portfolio Weights:**
- Asset A: 50%
- Asset B: 50%

**Your Task:** Calculate portfolio returns for each period

Portfolio Return = 0.5 × Asset A Return + 0.5 × Asset B Return

| Period | Asset A (%) | Asset B (%) | Portfolio (%) |
|--------|-------------|-------------|---------------|
| 1      | 10          | 12          | ?             |
| 2      | 6           | 8           | ?             |
| 3      | 14          | 16          | ?             |
| 4      | 2           | 4           | ?             |
| 5      | 18          | 20          | ?             |

---

### Step 4: Portfolio Risk Analysis

**Your Task:** Calculate portfolio standard deviation

Using the portfolio returns from Step 3, calculate:
- Portfolio mean return = ?
- Portfolio standard deviation = ?

Alternatively, the portfolio standard deviation can be calculated using the following formula:

$$\sigma_p^2 = w_A^2\sigma_A^2 + w_B^2\sigma_B^2 + 2w_Aw_B\rho_{AB}\sigma_A\sigma_B$$

**Compare:**
- Average volatility of individual assets = ?
- Portfolio volatility = ?
- Diversification benefit = ?

---

### Step 5: Reflection on Diversification

**Discussion Questions:**

1. How does the portfolio volatility compare to individual asset volatilities?
2. Keeping the mean return and volatility of Assets A and B unchanged:
   1. What would happen if correlation was 0.0 instead of 0.6?
   2. What would happen if correlation was 1.0?
   3. What would happen if correlation was $-1.0$?
3. **Investment Decision:** For a risk-averse investor, would you recommend:
   - Investing 100% in one asset, or
   - The equally-weighted portfolio?
   Explain your reasoning (3-4 sentences).

# Descriptive Analysis of Risk-free Rate and Pricing Factors

---

## Risk Free Rate (RFR)

Data sources for Norwegian risk-free rate (RFR):

- Before 2013 NIBOR: [Norges Bank](https://www.norges-bank.no/en/topics/Statistics/Historical-monetary-statistics/)

- After 2013 Norwegian Overnight Weighted Average rate: [Norske Finansielle Referenser AS (NoRe)](https://nore-benchmarks.com)

- [Titlon](https://titlon.uit.no/tabledefs.php): 3 months Norwegian Government Bills, from the `bondindex` table, `CloseYield field`.


Financial service companies publish surveys about financial data. For instance, PwC Norge.

- Here is their annual report about RFR: <https://www.pwc.no/no/publikasjoner/risikopremien.html>

---

**Data sources for pricing factors:**

- Fama-French factors can be obtained from [Ken French's website](http://mba.tuck.dartmouth.edu/pages/faculty/ken.french/data_library.html).

- You can get the data for different regions, e.g., US, Europe, Japan, etc.

```


.small-text[
**Key Observations:**

- **Market Risk Premium (Mkt-RF)**: Mean 0.60%, moderate volatility (4.57%), negative skewness suggests occasional large negative returns
- **Size Factor (SMB)**: Small positive mean (0.10%), high volatility (3.19%), positive skewness indicates frequent extreme positive returns for small-cap stocks
- **Value Factor (HML)**: Positive mean (0.18%), moderate characteristics, value stocks outperform growth stocks on average
- **Kurtosis**: All risk factors indicate fat tails (Kurtosis $>3$), suggesting higher likelihood of extreme returns compared to a normal distribution.
]

## Summary Statistics of Risk-Free Rate

```{r}
data_summary %>%
  slice(4) %>%
  kable(digits = 2, format = "html")
```

**Key Observations:**

- **Risk-Free Rate (RF)**: Low mean (0.15%) and volatility (0.16%), reflects varying interest rate environments
- **Kurtosis** $=2.2$: Suggests that risk-free rate has lighter tails than the normal distribution, suggesting lower likelihood of extreme returns.

## Visualization of Risk-Free Rate

```{r fig.width=12, fig.asp=0.5}
# Visualize RF
data %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = Date, y = RF)) +
  geom_line() +
  theme_minimal(base_size = 14) +

# Interpretation of Factor Models Results

The interpretation follows the principle of Multiple Linear Regression. 

Here we focus on 

- stocks' risk profile, measured by factor loadings (betas),
- the interpretation of implied stock characteristics,
- valuation: under- or over-valuation (alphas)

## Case Study: AAPL, SLAB, and KO

Company profiles:

- **Apple Inc. (AAPL)**: Mega-cap (~$3.5 trillion) technology leader company
- **Silicon Labs (SLAB)**: Small-cap (~$5–8 billion) technology growth company
- **Coca-Cola Co. (KO)**: Large-cap (~$270 billion) consumer staples company; defensive stock

## CAPM Review

CAPM as a regression can be expressed as

$$r_{t} - r_{f,t} = \alpha + \beta (r_{m,t}-r_{f,t}) + \varepsilon_{t}$$ 
where $\alpha$ (intercept) and $\beta$ (slope) are the parameters to estimate.

We use the following data to estimate the parameters.

-   $r_t$ is the return on the asset at time $t$;
-   $r_{m,t}$ is the return on the market portfolio;
-   $r_{f,t}$ is the risk free rate of interest; 
-   $r_t-r_{f,t}$ is the excess return on the asset;
-   $r_m-r_{f,t}$ is the Equity Risk Premium.

## Interpretation of CAPM Results
<!-- Using raw HTML to ensure class applies since markdown attribute was rendered literally -->
<h3 class="tight-top tight-bottom">Beta - Market Risk Exposure</h3>

* **Definition**: Beta measures the sensitivity of stock returns to overall market excess return. (systematic risk).
  * $\beta > 1$: Stock is more volatile than the market (high market risk).
  * $\beta < 1$: Stock is less volatile (defensive).
* **Results**:
  * **AAPL (β = 1.316\*\*\*):** Apple’s excess returns move about **1.3× the market**. This high beta suggests it is riskier than the market. Given Apple’s mega-cap size, the result reflects tech-sector cyclicality, despite its scale.
  * **SLAB (β = 1.477\*\*\*):** Even riskier, with **1.5× the market**. As a small-cap growth stock, SLAB is highly sensitive to market swings and investor sentiment.
  * **KO (β = 0.407\*\*\*):** Very defensive, with less than half the market’s volatility. KO’s beta reflects its consumer staples nature – demand is stable, making it less sensitive to market cycles.
* **Implication:** SLAB > AAPL > KO in terms of risk exposure to the market.

---

### Alpha (Intercept)

* **Definition**: Alpha represents abnormal return, i.e., the return not explained by market exposure. A positive and significant alpha suggests potential **undervaluation** or consistent outperformance; a negative alpha indicates **overvaluation** or underperformance.

* **Results**:

  * **AAPL (α = 0.015\*\*\*):** Positive and significant → Apple earned about **1.5% per period (monthly)** above what CAPM predicts. Suggests the market may **undervalue Apple**, or Apple consistently outperformed.
  * **SLAB (α = –0.00000):** Essentially zero and not significant → no abnormal return. SLAB’s performance is fully explained by its market exposure. Neither undervalued nor overvalued by CAPM.
  * **KO (α = 0.003):** Small, positive, but **not statistically significant**. Suggests KO’s returns are in line with its low-risk profile; no evidence of consistent outperformance.
---

### Other Statistics

* $R^2$ **(explanatory power):**

  * AAPL (0.300) and SLAB (0.253): Market explains about 25–30% of return variation – decent but leaves substantial idiosyncratic risk (typical for individual stocks).
  * KO (0.140): Only 14% explained → KO’s returns are less driven by market swings, more by firm-specific or industry factors.

* **Residual Std. Error:**

  * AAPL (0.092) and SLAB (0.116): Higher noise in returns, reflecting growth/tech volatility.
  * KO (0.046): Lower error → more stable, predictable returns.

* **F-statistic (all highly significant):** Confirms that the market factor (beta) is a strong predictor of returns for all three firms, despite differing R² levels.

---

### Summary

* **Apple (AAPL):** High beta, significant positive alpha → cyclical but delivering abnormal outperformance.
* **Silicon Labs (SLAB):** Very high beta, no alpha → highly risky, returns fully explained by market risk.
* **Coca-Cola (KO):** Low beta, stable defensive profile, no alpha → safer, predictable, but no abnormal return.

---

## FF 3-Factor Review

The Fama-French three-factor model as a regression can be expressed as

$$r_{t} - r_{f,t} = \alpha + \beta^{RMRF} (r_{m,t}-r_{f,t}) + \beta^{SMB}SMB_t + \beta^{HML}HML_t + \varepsilon_{t}$$ 
where $\alpha$ (intercept) and $\beta^{RMRF}$, $\beta^{SMB}$, $\beta^{HML}$ are the parameters to estimate.


---

## FF 3-Factor Results: Risk Profile Comparison

```{r echo=FALSE, results='asis'}
ff3_aapl <- lm(eRi ~ rmrf + SMB + HML, data = aapl_reg_data)
ff3_slab <- lm(eRi ~ rmrf + SMB + HML, data = slab_reg_data)
ff3_ko <- lm(eRi ~ rmrf + SMB + HML, data = ko_reg_data)

# Generate HTML table
ff3_tbl <- capture.output(
  stargazer(ff3_aapl, ff3_slab, ff3_ko,
    type = "html",
    title = "Fama-French 3-Factor Model Results: Risk Profile Comparison",
    dep.var.labels = "Excess Return",
    column.labels = c("AAPL (High Beta)", "SLAB (High Beta)", "KO (Low Beta)"),
    covariate.labels = c("Market Risk Premium", "SMB", "HML", "Alpha"),
    align = TRUE,
    digits = 3,
    digit.separator = "",
    omit.stat = c("LL"), # keep n, R2, Adj R2, F
    no.space = TRUE,
    single.row = FALSE,
    star.cutoffs = c(0.05, 0.01, 0.001)
  )
)

# Post-process: center numeric columns by adding a class to first column cells
ff3_tbl <- process_stargazer_html(ff3_tbl, star_class = "coef-stars")

cat('<div class="ff3-wrap">', paste(ff3_tbl, collapse = "\n"), "</div>")
```


---

## Interpretation of FF 3-Factor Results

<h3 class="tight-top tight-bottom">Market Risk Premium (Beta)</h3>

* **Results vs. CAPM:**

  * **AAPL (β = 1.273\*\*\*):** Still >1, confirming high exposure to market swings, but slightly lower than under CAPM (1.316). Including SMB and HML absorbs some of the variation that was previously attributed to the market.
  * **SLAB (β = 1.185\*\*\*):** Lower than CAPM (1.477). Suggests that part of SLAB’s return pattern is better explained by size (SMB).
  * **KO (β = 0.486\*\*\*):** Higher than CAPM (0.407), but still well below 1. KO’s risk is understated under CAPM; some risk is actually market-related once size and value are controlled.

* **Implication:** CAPM tends to overstate the market risk of growth-oriented small caps (like SLAB) and understate market risk of defensive firms (like KO).

---

### SMB (Small Minus Big) — Size Factor

* **Meaning:** Measures sensitivity to small-cap vs. large-cap performance.

  * Positive SMB → behaves more like a **small-cap**.
  * Negative SMB → behaves more like a **large-cap**.

* **Results:**

  * **AAPL (0.132, n.s.):** Insignificant, meaning Apple’s returns do not systematically align with small- or large-cap premiums. As a mega-cap, this makes sense.
  * **SLAB (1.489\*\*\*):** Strong positive loading → SLAB behaves like a **small-cap stock**. Consistent with its ~$5–8 billion size. Explains why its CAPM beta looked so high; part of its risk is actually **size exposure**.
  * **KO (–0.402\*\*\*):** Significant negative loading → KO behaves like a **large-cap stock**, benefiting from the “big stock premium.” Fits with KO’s ~$270 billion market cap and stable business.

---

### HML (High Minus Low) — Value Factor

* **Meaning:** Sensitivity to value (high book-to-market) vs. growth (low book-to-market) stocks.

  * Negative HML → behaves like a **growth stock**.
  * Positive HML → behaves like a **value stock**.

* **Results:**

  * **AAPL (–0.735\*\*\*):** Strongly negative → Apple loads as a **growth stock**. This matches its tech-sector profile and high valuation multiples.
  * **SLAB (–0.454\*):** Also negative → SLAB is a **growth-oriented** small-cap, consistent with being a tech innovator.
  * **KO (+0.142, n.s.):** Positive and significant → KO has characteristics of a **value stock**. Fits with consumer staples: stable earnings, lower growth, and value orientation.

---

### Alpha (Intercept)

* **Results:**

  * **AAPL (α = 0.017\*\*\*):** Still positive and significant → Apple delivers abnormal returns beyond market, size, and value factors. Suggests **persistent undervaluation or outperformance**.
  * **SLAB (α = 0.002, n.s.):** No abnormal return → fully explained by market + size + value exposures.
  * **KO (α = 0.002, n.s.):** No abnormal return → KO’s performance is consistent with its defensive, large-cap, value profile.

---

### Model Fit vs. CAPM

* **R² improves noticeably:**
  * AAPL: 0.30 → 0.36
  * SLAB: 0.25 → 0.37
  * KO: 0.14 → 0.22
* This shows the FF3 model explains more variation in returns, especially for SLAB and KO where size and value matter strongly.
* Residual standard errors fall slightly, meaning the model captures risk better than CAPM.

```{r echo=FALSE, results='asis'}
fit_comp <- tibble(
  Metric = c("Residual Std. Error: CAPM", "Residual Std. Error: FF-3"),
  AAPL = c("0.092", "0.089"),
  SLAB = c("0.116", "0.107"),
  KO = c("0.046", "0.044")
)
tbl_html <- fit_comp %>%
  knitr::kable(format = "html", align = c("l", "c", "c", "c")) %>%
  as.character()
tbl_html <- sub("<table", '<table class="fit-comp-table"', tbl_html)
cat('<div class="fit-comp-wrap">', tbl_html, "</div>")
```

---

### Summary

* **AAPL:** High beta, neutral size, strong growth profile, positive alpha. Apple is a **large-cap growth leader** with consistent outperformance.
* **SLAB:** High beta, small-cap, strong growth tilt, no alpha. SLAB is a **risky small-cap growth stock**, fully explained by FF factors.
* **KO:** Low beta, large-cap, value stock, no alpha. KO is a **defensive large-cap value stock**, with stable, predictable returns but no excess performance.

# Security Market Line

The Security Market Line (SML) is a graphical representation of the expected return of an asset vs. its risk, as measured by beta ($\beta$). 

Today, we focus on 

- construction of the SML using CAPM as an example
- determination of assets' valuation (under- or over-valuation) based on their position relative to the SML
 - determination of assets' valuation (under- or over-valuation) based on their position relative to the SML

---

## Security Market Line (Recap)

CAPM (in excess return form):  
$$E[r_i - r_f] = \alpha_i + \beta_i \; E[r_M - r_f]$$

SML equation (in raw return form):
$$E[r_i] = r_f + \beta_i \; E[r_M - r_f]$$


**Interpretation:**
- Point ABOVE the SML: offers a higher return than required for its beta → undervalued (underpriced)
- Point BELOW the SML: offers a lower return than required → overvalued (overpriced)

Example Setup (monthly returns):
- Risk‑free rate $r_f = 0.15\%$
- Expected market excess return (market risk premium) $E[r_M - r_f] = 0.60\%$

---

## Illustrative Example: Five Assets

```{r echo=FALSE, results='asis'}
rf <- 0.0015 # 0.15% monthly
mrp <- 0.0060 # 0.60% monthly expected excess market return

assets <- tibble(
  Ticker = c("KO", "DEF", "AAPL", "SLAB", "GROW"),
  Name = c("Coca-Cola Co.", "Defensive Fund", "Apple Inc.", "Silicon Labs", "Growth ETF"),
  Beta = c(0.40, 0.80, 1.30, 1.60, 1.00),
  Observed_Raw = c(0.0045, 0.0055, 0.0100, 0.0105, 0.0120) # observed average raw returns
)

assets <- assets %>%
  mutate(
    Expected_Raw = rf + Beta * mrp,
    Position = case_when(
      Observed_Raw > Expected_Raw + 1e-6 ~ "Above SML (Undervalued)",
      Observed_Raw < Expected_Raw - 1e-6 ~ "Below SML (Overvalued)",
      TRUE ~ "On SML (Fairly Valued)"
    )
  )

tbl <- assets %>%
  mutate(
    Beta = sprintf("%.2f", Beta),
    `Observed Raw %` = sprintf("%.2f", Observed_Raw * 100),
    `Expected Raw %` = sprintf("%.2f", Expected_Raw * 100)
  ) %>%
  select(Ticker, Name, Beta, `Observed Raw %`, `Expected Raw %`, Position)

tbl %>%
  kable(format = "html", align = c("l", "l", "c", "c", "c", "l"), caption = "Illustrative SML Comparison (Monthly Raw Returns)")
```

- Expected Raw = $r_f + \beta \times E[r_M - r_f] = (0.15+\beta \times 0.6)%$
- Observed Raw: historical average monthly raw return; what you actually observed

## Plot: Interpretation

Notes:

- Hollow crosses (×) mark the CAPM expected raw return for each beta. Solid circles show observed average raw returns.
- Green points (above line) indicate the asset offers more return than required → potential buy signal.
- Red points (below line) indicate less return than required → potential sell / avoid.
- The distance between points and the SML represents alpha ($\alpha_i$), shown for GROW as an example.

---

## Interpreting the Example

- KO: Slightly above SML → modest undervaluation; offers return premium for low beta.
- DEF: Below SML → overvalued vs. its risk, return insufficient.
- AAPL: Above SML → delivers more than required for its high beta.
- SLAB: Slightly below SML → compensation lower than required for very high beta.
- GROW: Clearly above SML → strongest undervaluation signal.

**Discussion:**

1. Which asset you'd invest in and which asset you'd allocate away from 
2. How changes in $r_f$ or $E[r_M-r_f]$ pivot or rotate the SML

### Impact Insights

- **Increase in equity risk premium ($E[r_M - r_f]$), holding $r_f$ constant:** 
  
  Slope steepens (rotation upward around intercept at beta = 0). High-beta assets now require more return; marginal undervaluation of high-beta names can vanish; low-beta assets may appear more undervalued.

### Impact Insights
- **Increase in $r_f$, holding $E[r_M-r_f]$ fixed:**
  
  The SML shifts up in parallel; slope stays the same. All points on the line move vertically upward by $\Delta r_f.$ No rotation occurs because the market risk premium is constant.




<!-- 
- **Increase in $r_f$, holding $E[r_M]$ fixed:**
  
  SML pivots around beta = 1 (point at $(1, E[r_M])$). Required return rises for low-beta assets (beta < 1) and falls for high-beta assets (beta > 1). Some low-beta “undervalued” points can drop closer to (or below) SML; some high-beta overvalued points may move to fairly valued.
